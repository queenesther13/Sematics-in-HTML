                <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    Dogs are unique creatures which can both be domestic and wild.
                     Most dogs are domestic and they live around us like german sherperds, bull dogs, etc.
                    I prefer dogs because they are very loyal and fun to play with.
                    Dogs are known to have saved a lot of people.
                    They are also facts that dogs can see and smell from a very far distance.
